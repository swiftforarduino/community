// Description: This allows you to read from the DHT11 or DHT22 temperature and humidity sensors,
// such as found in the S4A Elements hardware boxes or the Grove range from Seeed Studios.
typealias TempHumidityValues = (temperature: Int8, humidity: Int8, isValid: Bool)

// values are x10, float from int conversion not working in current avr backend build...
typealias TempHumidityValues22 = (temperature: Int16, humidity: Int16, isValid: Bool)

// as we don't have complex types (struct, enum, error) in the v1 compiler series
// we use a tuple to return information
// (cyclesUntilLogicStateChanged,LogicStateAtStart,TimedOut)
// hard to know what to do with timeouts, obviously they "shouldn't" happen
// but equally obviously the program must not hang if they do
// we take a best guess of ignoring them and reading them at the opening value
// which will make garbage data for that read but is better than a hang
